      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Miesha Martin, and I'm an aspiring web developer living in Carrollton Texas. I enjoy programming small things in python, hanging out with family, and having a nice boba tea once in a while.</p>
      <h2>My History</h2>
      <p>I took a web development course way back in highschool, and dabbled here and there after, but didn't pursue it seriously until recently. My knowledge and skills have definitely improved and I think it's amazing how it's possible to sketch out an idea and bring it into reality on various screens with html, css and code.</p>

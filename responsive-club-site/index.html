                    <p>We meet to safely watch every eclipse. These events are rare, but still a great way and reason to get together! Bring a friend, take a pair of special shades provided by the club if needed, and enjoy the view.</p>

                    <p>Whenever there's something interesting or spectacular being streamed by NASA, we try to plan in advance and get together to watch with each other and enjoy some fun snacks. Rocket shaped cookies are delicious.</p>

                    <p>When there's nothing else very special going on, we like to gather twice a month for a picnic under the stars. We ask each member to bring something to share with everyone, depending on how many expect to show up, along with any stargazing equipment.</p>
